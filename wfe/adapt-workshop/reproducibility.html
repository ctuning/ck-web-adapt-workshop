In 2007, we started a pilot project to share the whole experimental setups
(code, data, dependencies, models) along with our publications 
on machine learning based autotuning via <a href="http://cTuning.org">cTuning.org</a>
to be reproduced, validated and improved by the community.
Based on the success of this project, we decided to use similar 
approach for this ADAPT workshop, i.e. encourage authors to either 
provide a paragraph in their submitted papers describing how to validate
their experimental results, or to submit all related artifacts 
along with their publication to be validated by the community.
<br>
<br>
We hope that such approach will enable truly collaborative, rigorous
and reproducible research and experimentation in computer engineering,
particularly needed on our way towards adaptive, self-tuning computer systems.
