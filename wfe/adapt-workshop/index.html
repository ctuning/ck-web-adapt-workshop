Computing systems are rapidly evolving into heterogeneous many-core machines. 
Developing such systems and optimizing real applications is becoming extremely
complex, tedious and time consuming due to an unprecedented number
of available design and optimization choices across 
the whole software and hardware stack.

<p>
Using outdated, non-adaptive, non-systematic and ad-hoc design and optimization
methodology with non-representative benchmarks and data sets
often results in highly inefficient software and hardware
while wasting expensive computing resources and energy,
and slowing down time to market for new products.

<p>
ADAPT is an interdisciplinary workshop to discuss and demonstrate
practical and reproducible techniques, methodology and tools 
that can help convert existing or future software and hardware 
into adaptive, scalable and self-tuning systems. Such systems should be 
able to automatically improve their characteristics (execution time, energy usage,
size, adaptation time, precision, reliability and memory usage)
depending on an application and its input, available resources,
run-time state of the system, and user requirements. 

<p>
ADAPT topics include <i>but are not limited to</i> autotuning,
machine learning based adaptation, representative benchmarking, 
automatic performance modeling, self-tuning compilers, run-time adaptation,
automatic fault tolerance, dynamic hardware reconfiguration,
predictive scheduling, new programming models, green data centers, 
reproducible empirical experimentation, and optimization knowledge 
sharing. You can check out accepted papers from the 
past ADAPT workshops <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$prior_workshops$#ck_page_suffix#$#menu_software">here</a>.

Note, that we use exclusively our new submission model where
authors submit their articles directly to <a href="http://www.arxiv.org">ArXiv</a>
while we immediately open a discussion thread at <a
href="http://reddit.com/r/reviewpapers">Reddit</a>. This allows authors
get an immediate feedback from the community, defend their techniques, 
fix obvious flaws, and improve their articles. It also helps Program
Chairs select the most appropriate, realistic and reproducible
techniques for the final review by the ADAPT PC members. 
Hence, we also strongly encourage authors share related code, data and
expeirmental results along with their article to help the
community validate their approach and even immediately start
using it. We believe that such publication model will let authors
disseminate their ideas and tools much faster while avoiding
unfair reviews and plagiarism (even if submitted paper is not accepted,
it is already published as a technical report with a time stamp and can 
be incrementaly improved based on the received feeback).
