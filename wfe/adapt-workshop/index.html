<p>Computing systems are rapidly evolving into heterogeneous
machines featuring many processor cores. This leads to
a tremendous complexity with an unprecedented number
of available design and optimization choices for
architectures, applications, compilers and run-time systems.
Using outdated, non-adaptive technology results in an
enormous waste of expensive computing resources and energy,
while slowing down time to market.

<p>The 6th International Workshop on Adaptive Self-tuning
Computing Systems is an interdisciplinary forum for
researchers, practitioners, developers and application
writers to discuss ideas, experience, methodology,
applications, compilers, hardware, practical techniques and
tools that can improve or change existing and future
computing systems using self-tuning technology. Such systems
should be able to automatically adjust their behavior at all
levels (hardware and software) and improve various
characteristics including execution time, energy usage,
reliability, size and costs based on empirical, dynamic,
iterative, auto-tuning, statistical, collective,
bio-inspired, machine learning and alternative techniques
while fully utilizing available resources.

<p>Along with the traditional publication model, we will
continue validating a new open publication model where
community pre-reviews articles, shared artifacts and
experimental results [ doc, wiki ]!
