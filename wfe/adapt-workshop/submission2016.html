<p>
Based on positive personal experience and positive feedback from
the community about our open submission and publication model (<a
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2618137.2618142">ACM DL</a> / <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4020">arXiv</a>). where papers,
artifacts and experimental results are submitted directly via
ArXiv and then openly discussed and pre-validated by the
community, we decided to use it exclusively for ADAPT 2016 (see
ADAPT <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$motivation2016$#ck_page_suffix#$">motivation
page</a>).

<p>
We invite two types of papers:
<ul>
 <li>
  <b>T1:</b> Research Papers (between 2 and 8 pages long)
  presenting novel techniques including wild & crazy ideas.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>T2:</b> Software/Hardware Demonstration (must be your own)
  presenting publicly available and adaptive applications, tools
  and hardware. Description should be up to 6 pages long
  summarizing demonstration. The relevance to the workshop should
  be specified in the abstract submitted via EasyChair.
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
Submissions should be in PDF, preferably formatted with double
column/single-spacing, using 10pt fonts and printable on US
letter or A4 sized paper.

<p>
Authors submit a paper via ADAPT 2016 <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adapt2016">EasyChair website</a> 
at any time before the submission deadline (please provide above prefix
T1 or T2 in the title). We will immediately give authors
instructions about how to upload their paper to <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a>
(allow 2..3 days before your article becomes available online).
Alternatively, authors can submit their paper directly to ArXiv
and then submit an abstract to EasyChair with the link to their
paper. As soon as this paper is publicly available, we open
a discussion thread on the <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit social platform</a> 
to allow the community to evaluate and comment on it (the authors can respond
to all the comments at any time to promote, explain and defend
their technique). Note that we encourage earlier submissions
before the deadline to allow more time for open discussions.
We also allow submission of your own papers already available
in any open archive if they are related to ADAPT topics.

<p>
After three weeks of public discussions, we will close the
discussion thread and let the Program Committee members reach
their acceptance decisions based on their own evaluation and from
the comments of others (including the authors) found on the
discussion thread. Papers accepted for presentation at the
workshop may later include a link to the public reddit
discussion.

<p>
Importantly, ADAPT workshop has a special focus on practical,
scalable and reproducible techniques. Hence, we strongly
encourage authors to share their packed artifacts (code, data,
models, experimental results) and provide a paragraph in their
submitted papers describing how to validate their technique and
experimental results together with a link to their artifacts.
Paper with highest ranked artifacts shared in 
<a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck">Collective Knowledge format</a>
will receive a cash prize of 200 euros from our sponsor (see
<a href="http://cknowledge.org/repo/web.php?wcid=29db2248aba45e59:cd11e3a188574d80">example of a CK-powered paper</a>).
Papers with validated artifacts will receive a stamp:
