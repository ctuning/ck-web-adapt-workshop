<i>Since we now use popular <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$motivation2016$#ck_page_suffix#$">open publication model</a>
to avoid unfair or wrong reviews and let authors have a time stamp on their publications,
<b>we simplified submission procedure</b>: you can submit a new paper in your own formatting 
or even just a link to your published paper which you would like to present at ADAPT 
(it should be available in any open archive). You can also republish extended paper later
while immediately promoting your research via <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit social network</a>!</i>

<p>
We are interested in lively workshop discussions 
and invite the following papers:
<ul>
 <li>
  Research Papers (between 2 and 8 pages long*)
  presenting novel techniques including early stage work 
  and wild & crazy ideas.
 </li>
 <li>
  Software/Hardware Demonstration (must be your own)
  presenting publicly available and adaptive applications, 
  tools and hardware, or reproducing past experiments. 
  Description should be up to 6 pages long*
  summarizing demonstration. 
 </li>
 <li>
  Previously published papers if they are related to ADAPT
  topics and are available in any open archive.
 </li>
</ul>
* - since we use ArXiv, there is no strict limit after the first
round of public reviews (to let authors address all questions).

<p>
Submissions should be in PDF, preferably formatted with double
column/single-spacing, using 10pt fonts and printable on US
letter or A4 sized paper. Authors submit a paper via 
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adapt2016">EasyChair website for ADAPT 2016</a>. 
We then help authors to upload their paper to <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a>
(allow 2..3 days before your article becomes available online).
Alternatively, authors can submit their paper directly to ArXiv
and then submit an abstract to EasyChair with the link to their
paper. 

<p>
As soon as this paper is publicly available, we open
a discussion thread on the <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit social platform</a> 
to allow the community to comment on it (the authors can respond
to all the comments at any time to promote, explain and defend
their technique). After one or two  weeks of public discussions, 
we will close the discussion thread and let the Program Committee members 
reach their acceptance decisions based on their own evaluation and from
the comments of others (including the authors) found on the
discussion thread. Papers accepted for presentation at the
workshop may later include a link to the public Reddit
discussion. More importantly, even if your paper is not accepted, 
you still have a public technical report with a time stamp
which you can extend and republish later. 

<p>
Importantly, ADAPT workshop has a special focus on practical,
scalable and reproducible techniques. Hence, we encourage 
authors to share their packed artifacts (code, data,
models, experimental results) and provide a paragraph in their
submitted papers describing how to validate their technique and
experimental results together with a link to their artifacts
(see our <a href="http://cTuning.org/ae">artifact evaluation website</a> for more details).

Highest ranked reproducible artifact (code and/or data) shared in 
<a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck">Collective Knowledge format</a>
(we can help if needed) will receive a cash prize of 200 euros from our sponsor (see
a few recent examples: <a href="http://cknowledge.org/repo/web.php?wcid=29db2248aba45e59:cd11e3a188574d80">CK-powered interactive paper</a>,
benchmarks in CK-format <a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ctuning-programs">shared via GITHUB</a>, 
some data sets in CK format <a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ctuning-datasets-min">shared via GITHUB</a>).
Papers with validated artifacts will receive a stamp:
