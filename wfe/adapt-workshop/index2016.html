<p>
Computing systems are rapidly evolving into heterogeneous
many-core machines. Developing such systems and optimizing real
applications is becoming extremely complex, tedious and time
consuming due to an unprecedented number of available design and
optimization choices across the whole software and hardware
stack. Using outdated, non-adaptive, non-systematic and ad-hoc
design and optimization methodology with non-representative
benchmarks and data sets often results in a highly inefficient
software and hardware with a lack of performance portability and
scalability, waste or expensive computing resources and energy,
and slowing down time to market for new techniques and products.

<p>
ADAPT is an interdisciplinary workshop to discuss and demonstrate
practical and reproducible techniques, methodology and tools that
can help convert existing or future software and hardware into
adaptive, scalable and self-tuning systems. Such systems should
be able to automatically improve their characteristics (execution
time, energy usage, size, accuracy, reliability, bandwidth,
adaptation time and memory usage) depending on an application and
its input, available resources, run-time state of the system, and
user requirements.

<p>
ADAPT topics include <b><i>but are not limited to</b> machine
learning based autotuning, representative benchmarking, real
application self-tuning, automatic performance modeling,
self-tuning compilers, automatic bug detection, run-time
adaptation, automatic fault tolerance, dynamic hardware
reconfiguration, predictive scheduling, new programming models,
green data centers, adaptive embedded devices, reproducible
experimentation, and optimization knowledge sharing</i>. You can
check out accepted papers from the past ADAPT workshops
